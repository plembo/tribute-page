          <p>Before the Apollo 11 Eagle landed on the Moon, there was another called Snoopy.</p>
          <p>They were identical, these two odd looking spacecraft with spindly legs and paper thin walls.</p>
          <h3>Snoopy, like Eagle:</h3>
          <ul class="list-style">
            <li>Was carefully constructed in a Bethpage, Long Island clean room.</li>
            <li>Had a silvery upper ascent stage, and a lower, gold foil-wrapped descent stage</li>
            <li>Flew in Lunar orbit with its two man crew</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>But they were different in two ways:</h3>
          <ul class="list-style">
            <li>Snoopy never landed on the Moon</li>
            <li>Snoopy is still out there, in space, somewhere</li>
          </ul>
            <blockquote>
                    As she crossed from the Leakey to the primitive lunar module,
                    Gan recognized the faded red, white, and blue symbol that represented
                    the classic 50-state alliance at the height of its global preeminence,
                    a time of technological triumph, social unrest, and dietary disaster.
                    She noted the fine coating of dust that covered the lunar module ascent
                    stage and took great pains not to disturb it, except for one small patch.
                    There, she wiped clear a small area to reveal the image of a stylized
                    dog with a long snout. Above the dog was the word "Snoopy."
