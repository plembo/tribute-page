              <p>Before the Eagle that first landed on the Moon, there was another called Snoopy.</p>
              <p>They were identical, these two odd looking spacecraft with spindly legs and paper thin walls.</p>
              <h3>Snoopy, like Eagle:</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>was carefully constructed in a Bethpage, Long Island clean room.</li>
                    <li>had a silvery upper ascent stage, and a lower, gold foil-wrapped descent stage</li>
                    <li>flew in Lunar orbit with its two man crew</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h3>But they were different in two ways:</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Snoopy never landed on the Moon</li>
                    <li>Snoopy is still out there, in space, somewhere</li>
                 </ul>
